				<h5 id="scrollspyHeading1" class="text-center">Chicken</h5>
<p>Each of these stages was once a separate enterprise, but today, much of the chicken industry is vertically integrated, resulting in greater efficiencies and higher product quality. Tyson Foods’ chicken operations are fully vertically integrated.The broiler chicken production process begins with the grandparent breeder flocks. The breeder flocks are raised to maturity in grandparent growing and laying farms where fertile eggs are produced. Pullets hatch from the fertile eggs, and they are sent to breeder houses. The pullets produce fertile eggs, which are sent to hatcheries.Shortly after the eggs hatch, the chicks are sent to broiler farms. There, contract farmers care for and raise the chicks according to company standards. When the broilers reach the desired processing weight, they are caught and taken to processing plants. The finished chicken products are sent to distribution centers then transported to customers who sell the chicken to consumers.Vertically integrated poultry companies operate feed mills to produce scientifically formulated feeds. Corn and soybean meal are major production costs in the poultry industry, representing 47% of the cost of growing a chicken in 2008. In addition to diet, advances in selective breeding, improved production technologies and better management practices have enabled the industry to grow broilers faster and with less feed. In 1925, it took 16 weeks and almost 12 pounds of feed to grow a 2.5 pound chicken. Today a chicken more than twice that size can be grown in less than half the time with only 11 pounds of feed. Chicken is the most efficient of the meat proteins in feed conversion.There are essentially three ways chicken products are marketed, ranging from raw commodity at the lowest end to fully-cooked, value-added products on the high end. Of the three major proteins, chicken has provided the most opportunities for adding value.</p>
<h5 id="scrollspyHeading2" class="text-center">Sushi</h5>
<p>A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司, "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish.[6] The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The process can be traced back to the early domestication of rice in the Neolithic cultures of China.[citation needed] Fermentation methods following similar logic in other Asian rice cultures include prahok (ប្រហុក), pla ra (ปลาร้า), burong isda, sikhae (식해), and amazake (甘酒).The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the next months, and narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting", as the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. The term comes from an antiquated し shi terminal-form conjugation, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui (酸い, "to be sour"),[8] resulting in the term sushi (酸し).[9] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[10] Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or hako-zushi; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[10] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[13][14] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[15] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries </p>
<h5 id="scrollspyHeading3" class="text-center">Beef</h5>
<p>People have eaten the flesh of bovines since prehistoric times; some of the earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes.[6] People domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and leather.[7] Cattle have been domesticated at least twice over the course of evolutionary history. The first domestication event occurred around 10,500 years ago with the evolution of Bos taurus. The second was more recent, around 7,000 years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the Indus Valley. There is a possible third domestication event 8,500 years ago, with a potential third species Bos africanus arising in Africa.[8] Most cattle originated in the Old World, with the exception of bison hybrids, which originated in the Americas. Examples include the Wagyū from Japan, Ankole-Watusi from Egypt, and longhorn Zebu from the Indian subcontinent.In the United States, the growth of the beef business was largely due to expansion in the Southwest. Upon the acquisition of grasslands through the Mexican–American War of 1848, and later the expulsion of the Plains Indians from this region and the Midwest, the American livestock industry began, starting primarily with the taming of wild longhorn cattle. Chicago and New York City were the first to benefit from these developments in their stockyards and in their meat markets.Beef cattle are raised and fed using a variety of methods, including feedlots, free range, ranching, backgrounding and intensive animal farming. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), commonly referred to as factory farms, are commonly used to meet the demand of beef production. CAFOs supply 70.4% of cows in the US market and 99% of all meat in the United States supply.[11] Cattle CAFOs can also be a source of E. coli contamination in the food supply[12] due to the prevalence of manure in CAFOs. These E. coli contaminations include one strain, E. coli O157:H7, which can be toxic to humans, because cattle typically hold this strain in their digestive system.[13] Another consequence of unsanitary conditions created by high-density confinement systems is increased use of antibiotics in order to prevent illness.[14] An analysis of FDA sales data by the Natural Resources Defense Council found 42% of medically important antibiotic use in the U.S. was on cattle, posing concerns about the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria.</p>
